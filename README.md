# tkl2-60percent
a simple autohotkey script that adds certain extra key commands to emulate a 60% board with a tkl
so it takes inspiration from other 60% boards like anne pro 2 and ducky 2 mini
capslock +ijkl are arrow keys
\` is escape
shift+capslock is the original capslock

if you really want to emulate the experience then you can just put paper over the tkl-only parts like me
